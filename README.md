# Learning Repo
### A repository dedicated to me, learning all sorts of technologies. And maybe implementing them in the future in other projects.

#### Stuff learnt/learning
* Auth0/Supabase
	* Auth0 Authentication
	* Supabase PostgreSQL database
	* This little project involved Auth0 authentication using an express package _express-openid-connect_ which allows for user authentication in a Node.js/Express.js back-end. Supabase provides a nice PostgreSQL which _can_ scale, plus I know SQL but I never approached it at a high level.
